These are attributed to Robert C. Martin.\n\n* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A entity should have only one  responsibility. E.G. implementing database logic and error handling logic as seperate entities.\n\n* **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes, Objects, modules, etc. should be open for extension but closed for modification. While we can 'add' new code, care should be taken it does not impact current code.\n\n* **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. The 'child' class inherits the functionality of its 'parent' class and can extend the functionality but not impact the 'parent' class's functionality.\n\n* **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. We should avoid the creation of large, general-purpose interfaces; create specific ones.\n\n\n* **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Entities must depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces) rather than concrete classes or functions.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**What is Dependency Injection (DI)?**\n\n* A design pattern\n* It helps implement the \"Dependency Inversion Principle\" (DIP) principle, which advocates loose coupling and flexibility.\n* Widely used in software development","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**What is a Dependency Injection (DI) container?**\n\n* A software component\n* Provides necessary objects to other parts of the application\n* Abstracts the handling of ojects from other parts of the application\n* Can handle the lifecycle of such objects - creating or reusing existing instance","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**How does DI container work?**\n\n* We provide information on how to create and manage 'dependent' objects\n* When the 'dependent' object is required, the DI retrieves the instance\n* The DI can decide if it has to create a new instance everytime the 'dependent' object is called or share the existing one","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Why DI container?**\n\n* **Centralized Management**: All 'dependent' objects are management centrally,making it easier to manage them\n* **Loose Coupling**:  Classes need not know their dependencies or create them as these are provided through DI\n* **Testing**: We can mock these 'dependencies' via mock objects or stubs thereby, helping testing.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In \"Microsoft Semantic Kernel\", the Kernel is a \"Dependency Injection\" container, which manages all the services and plugins necessary to run the AI application.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
