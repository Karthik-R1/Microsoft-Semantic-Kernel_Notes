| Rule-Based Reasoning       | Uses predefined if-then rules to guide decisions.                           | Matches input data against a set of rules to execute actions.                                     | Expert systems, scripted chatbots.                                        | Simple, interpretable, effective in well-defined domains.                  | Struggles with uncertainty, scalability, and novel scenarios.                |
| Probabilistic Reasoning    | Handles uncertainty using probability theory.                               | Employs Bayesian networks or Markov models to compute likely outcomes.                            | Robotics (SLAM), NLP (sentiment analysis), medical diagnostics.            | Robust in uncertain environments, incorporates new evidence.               | Computationally intensive, requires accurate probability distributions.      |
| Logical Reasoning          | Uses formal logic to derive conclusions from premises.                      | Applies deductive, inductive, or abductive reasoning using propositional or first-order logic.     | Automated theorem proving, knowledge-based systems, robotic
