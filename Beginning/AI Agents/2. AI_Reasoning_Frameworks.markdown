| Rule-Based Reasoning       | Uses predefined if-then rules to guide decisions.                           | Matches input data against a set of rules to execute actions.                                     | Expert systems, scripted chatbots.                                        | Simple, interpretable, effective in well-defined domains.                  | Struggles with uncertainty, scalability, and novel scenarios.                |
| Probabilistic Reasoning    | Handles uncertainty using probability theory.                               | Employs Bayesian networks or Markov models to compute likely outcomes.                            | Robotics (SLAM), NLP (sentiment analysis), medical diagnostics.            | Robust in uncertain environments, incorporates new evidence.               | Computationally intensive, requires accurate probability distributions.      |
| Logical Reasoning          | Uses formal logic to derive conclusions from premises.                      | Applies deductive, inductive, or abductive reasoning using propositional or first-order logic.     | Automated theorem proving, knowledge-based systems, robotic planning.      | Rigorous, provably correct in structured domains.                          | Limited flexibility in dynamic or ambiguous environments.                   |
| Case-Based Reasoning       | Solves problems by adapting solutions from similar past cases.              | Matches current problems to a case library and adapts prior solutions.                            | Legal reasoning, medical diagnosis, customer support.                     | Effective with historical data, learns from experience.                    | Requires robust case library, struggles with novel problems.                |
| Model-Based Reasoning      | Uses a model of the world to simulate and predict outcomes.                 | Builds or uses predefined models (e.g., physical, causal) to reason about actions and consequences.| Autonomous vehicles, game AI, simulation-based planning.                  | Enables predictive reasoning in complex systems.                           | Relies on model accuracy; errors reduce effectiveness.                      |
| Reinforcement Learning     | Learns optimal actions through trial-and-error to maximize rewards.         | Interacts with environment, updates policy using feedback (e.g., Q-learning, deep RL).            | Game AI (AlphaGo), robotic control, resource allocation.                  | Adapts to complex, dynamic environments without explicit rules.            | Requires extensive training, slow convergence, lacks interpretability.      |
| Neural Reasoning           | Uses neural networks to approximate reasoning by learning patterns from data.| Neural architectures (e.g., transformers) process inputs for decisions or predictions.             | Language models (GPT, BERT), image recognition, autonomous systems.        | Scales well with data, handles unstructured inputs.                        | Black-box nature, high computational cost, limited explainability.          |
| Hybrid Reasoning           | Combines multiple frameworks to leverage their strengths.                   | Integrates approaches like rule-based with RL or neural with symbolic reasoning (e.g., neuro-symbolic).| Self-driving cars, advanced chatbots.                                  | Balances interpretability, adaptability, and robustness.                   | Complex to design and integrate.                                           |
| Heuristic-Based Reasoning  | Uses simplified rules or shortcuts to make decisions efficiently.           | Applies domain-specific heuristics to approximate optimal solutions.                              | Pathfinding (A* search), game AI, scheduling systems.                      | Fast, computationally efficient.                                          | May produce suboptimal solutions, relies on heuristic quality.              |
