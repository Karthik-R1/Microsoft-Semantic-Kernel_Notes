E.G., 'chat completion'and 'text generation'. There are other experimental services given [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts/ai-services/).\n    \n* **Enterprise components**: We can leverage enterprise level services like 'filters', 'logging', 'metrics'\n\n* **Build the kernel**: In Python, we can leverage the \"AI Service\" from the object directly.\n\n* **Add memory**: The ability to store and retrieve information from the agents past interactions, to improve its future actions.\n\n* **Add plugins**: These are the components that are used by your AI services and prompt templates to perform work. E.G., plugins to retrieve data from a database.\n\n* **Create kernel arguments**: These provide a way to give inputs to functions and plugins within the Semantic Kernel. They are in the form of a key-value pair.\n\n* **Create prompts**: Input texts that guide the LLMs. We can configure 'Prompt templages' that provide a tructured and reusable way to define its behavior.\n\n* **Planning**: Helps LLMs call approparite functions to achieve the user's request. Auto function calling is the default behavior in Semantic Kernel, but you can also manually invoke functions as well.\n\n* **Invoke**: Executing the Agent with steps configured above.\n\nWhile not all the above steps are required for every AI Agent, the order in which they are listed is to be followed.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Semantic Kernel currently supports .Net (C#), Java and Python programming languages and has libraries created in each of these languages.","metadata":{}}]}
